# Functional Programming Course Solutions - FMI, Sofia University

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to various tasks from the **Functional Programming** course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics (FMI), Sofia University. The tasks cover a range of functional programming concepts, providing practice and insight into core paradigms in the field.

## Structure

Each task is organized by topic, and solutions are implemented using languages commonly associated with functional programming, such as Racket, Haskell, or others, depending on the course requirements. Each folder includes:
- **Task Description**: Outlining the problem statement.
- **Solution**: The implemented solution code.
- **Comments/Documentation**: Explanations of the approach, highlighting functional programming techniques used.

## Topics Covered

- **Recursion**: Solutions involving recursive functions for list processing, tree traversal, and other recursive structures.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Implementations using functions that take other functions as parameters or return them as results.
- **Immutability**: Approaches to handling data without modifying it, adhering to functional programming principles.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Examples and explanations where applicable.
- **Pattern Matching**: Task solutions that utilize pattern matching to handle data structures concisely.

## Getting Started
